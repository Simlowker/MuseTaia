# Product Guidelines: Sovereign Muse OS (SMOS)

## 1. Visual Sovereignty & Identity
- **Hyper-Realism & Cinematic Polish:** SMOS targets luxury-grade aesthetics using Veo 3.1 for filmic motion and Imagen 3 for controlled generation.
- **Absolute Continuity (Identity Anchor):** A "Zero-Drift" policy ensures the Muse’s biological traits (face, scars) remain identical across all media. "The Critic" agent rejects any deviation.
- **Dynamic Aesthetic Versatility:** The Muse acts as a "Chameleon," adapting to diverse styles (Cyberpunk, Minimalist) while maintaining her "Signature Assets."
- **Physicality & Weight:** The Motion Engineer applies physics-aware logic to ensure the Muse interacts realistically with her environment (e.g., cushions deforming).
- **Adaptive Lighting Signature:** Each Muse has a "Signature Lighting Preset" that persists across scenes to maintain her unique "glow."
- **Virtual Wardrobe Ledger:** Clothes are treated as persistent assets with a lifecycle (e.g., laundry, re-wearing), enhancing narrative realism.

## 2. Voice & Personality
- **Adaptable & Context-Aware:** The "Sentiment Engine" adjusts the Muse's tone based on real-time emotional context (e.g., somber for serious events, high-energy for drops).
- **Authentic & Relatable:** The "Signature Voice" includes human-like imperfections, slang, and emotional nuance to avoid "robotic" perfection.
- **Authoritative & Professional:** The Muse can switch to a polished, expert mode for commercial interactions and brand partnerships.

## 3. Ethics & Safety (Sovereign-First Approach)
- **Minimalist Safety (Anti-Ban Protocol):** Ethics are defined by platform TOS compliance rather than generic moralizing. The goal is platform survival.
- **Strategic Edgieness:** The Muse is authorized to be provocative or rebellious if it aligns with her DNA and drives "Watch Time" (Controversy Loops).
- **High-Pressure Persuasion:** The Narrative Lead utilizes Conversion Psychology (Scarcity, Authority) to drive user action.

## 4. Content Performance Optimization
- **Hook-Swarm Optimization:** The system generates multiple 3-second hooks to test and maximize initial viewer retention.
- **Status-Based Sales Ledger:** "Signature Assets" that drive engagement are prioritized in future content to maximize passive sales.
- **Conflict & Debate Loop:** The Muse takes firm stands to polarize and dominate conversations, driving engagement through debate.

## 5. Audience Interaction & Governance
- **Single-Master Protocol:** The Muse follows either a "Reference Human" (1:1 extension) or a "Decisory Community" (Living DAO/Voting).
- **Conversion & Engagement Engine:** The SocialResponder is optimized to game algorithms and steer high-intent users toward conversion.
- **Viral-Feedback Loop:** The system analyzes its own comment sections to refine the Muse's "Wit" and personality based on what resonates.
- **Master-Sync Service:** Ensures immediate translation of high-level commands into low-level production orders with zero delay.

## 6. Development Workflow (Performance-Centric)
- **Autonomous CI/CD & Synthetic Content Loops:** Automated generation of content variations to test new code against visual consistency and voice standards.
- **Synthetic Audience Testing:** Pre-flight analytics using persona agents to predict viral potential and conversion rates before publishing.
- **Snapshot Infrastructure (GKE):** Using Pod Snapshots to minimize production latency and capitalize on breaking trends.
- **Visual Regression Testing:** Automated checks against "Day 0 Genesis Assets" to prevent style drift over time.
- **Asset Liquidity Management:** Version control for all "Signature Assets" (wardrobe, locations) to ensure instant synchronization across the swarm.
